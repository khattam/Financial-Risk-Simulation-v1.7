# Financial-Risk-Simulation-v1.7

## Overview
The Financial-Risk-Simulation-v1.7 is a financial risk assessment tool designed to simulate systemic risks in interbank lending, loan portfolios, and cascading bank failures across multiple financial institutions. This tool helps financial institutions and analysts forecast market volatility, manage liquidity, and understand potential risks associated with loan defaults under a variety of economic conditions.

The simulation is built with a focus on high data loads and distributed computing, using cloud infrastructure to parallelize complex financial calculations, making it capable of handling large-scale datasets with enhanced performance.

**Note**: Running this simulation can be **resource-intensive**. As the number of nodes (financial institutions) increases, the number of computations increases **exponentially**, requiring considerable computational power. Users should ensure adequate resources, particularly when simulating large, interconnected banking networks, or when using distributed simulations across multiple EC2 instances.

## Features
- **Risk Simulation for Interbank Lending**: Models interactions between banks, simulating liquidity issues and defaults across interconnected financial institutions.
- **Loan Portfolio Risk Analysis**: Assesses systemic risks in loan portfolios, helping institutions manage default risks effectively.
- **Cascading Bank Failure Simulation**: Simulates the impact of one or more bank failures on the broader financial system, providing insights into how risks propagate through the banking network.
- **Distributed Simulation**: Leverages AWS EC2 for running distributed simulations, ensuring scalability for large datasets.
- **Performance Optimization**: Implements multithreading and indexing techniques to optimize query performance and reduce computation time for high data loads.
- **Cloud Integration**: Utilizes cloud services for distributed computing and storage, allowing for efficient data management and enhanced simulation capabilities.
- **Data Management**: Manages large datasets, including transaction and liquidity data, using MS SQL Server to ensure efficient data retrieval and analysis.

## Tech Stack
- **Java**: Core programming language used to implement financial models and run simulations.
- **AWS EC2**: Cloud infrastructure for distributed computing, enabling large-scale simulations.
- **MS SQL Server**: Database used for storing and managing transaction and liquidity data.
- **Docker**: Containerization for consistent deployment across environments.
- **JUnit**: Unit testing framework used to ensure the reliability of code and simulation accuracy.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Java 11 or higher
- MS SQL Server (for database management)
- Docker (for containerization)
- AWS Account (for EC2 instances if running distributed simulations)

### Steps to Install and Run the Tool

1. **Clone the Repository**: Download the code to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/Financial-Risk-Simulation-v1.7.git
    ```

2. **Set Up the Database**: Configure MS SQL Server and import the provided database schema (located in the `/db` folder of the repository). Update the `application.properties` file with your database credentials:
    ```properties
    spring.datasource.url=jdbc:sqlserver://localhost:1433;databaseName=yourDB
    spring.datasource.username=your-username
    spring.datasource.password=your-password
    ```

3. **Set Up AWS EC2 Instances (optional)**: If you are running distributed simulations, launch your EC2 instances and configure the IP addresses in the simulationâ€™s cloud settings file.

4. **Build the Project**: Use Maven to build the project:
    ```bash
    ./mvnw clean install
    ```

5. **Run the Simulation**: Start the application using Spring Boot:
    ```bash
    ./mvnw spring-boot:run
    ```

6. **Run Tests**: Run the unit tests to verify the integrity of the simulation:
    ```bash
    ./mvnw test
    ```

## Usage
Once the application is running, you can interact with the simulation using the provided endpoints (detailed below). The simulation will process input data, such as bank transaction data and loan portfolios, and output a detailed risk assessment, including potential cascading failures and liquidity shortfalls.

### Endpoints
- **POST /api/simulate/risk**: Run a new risk simulation.
    - **Input**: Bank transaction data, loan portfolios.
    - **Output**: Risk score, potential failures, and cascading effects.
  
- **GET /api/simulate/status**: Check the status of a running simulation.

- **GET /api/report**: Retrieve a detailed report of the simulation, including risk factors, loan default risks, and liquidity forecasts.

- **POST /api/simulate/terminate**: Terminate a running simulation.

## Future Enhancements
- **Scenario-based Simulations**: Allow users to simulate financial crises or shocks, such as a housing market crash, to analyze the impact on the banking system.
- **Machine Learning Integration**: Incorporate machine learning models to predict risk more accurately based on historical data patterns and market indicators.
- **Visualization Dashboard**: Develop a web-based dashboard for real-time visualization of the simulation results, providing users with interactive charts and reports.
- **Credit Rating Prediction**: Integrate models that predict the creditworthiness of banks and loan portfolios based on simulation outcomes.
